#Eight Queens Demos

This Repo is a collection of search and CSP solutions to the N queens problem. I have tried to comment as much as possible to try and make the code easy to follow for people trying to learn. I also tried to follow OOP practices and Jave conventions as best as possible. First and foremost the idea is to provide examples from which to learn.
